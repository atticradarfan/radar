Further downstream...where the creek\nmerges with the Chattahoochee River...the Big Creek and Azalea\nparks near Roswell Road and along Riverside Road and Azalea Drive\nbegin to flood. If the Roswell gage on the Chattahoochee River is\n7.5 feet or higher...then the combination of flows will cause the\naccess road to the Huntcliff horse stables across from Azalea Park\nto flood.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- At 3:15 AM EDT Saturday the stage was 11.2 feet.\n- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours\nending at 3:15 AM EDT Saturday was 12.4 feet.\n- Forecast...No forecast is available for this location.\n- Flood stage is 10.0 feet.\n- Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of\n11.2 feet on 10/11/2020.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood",

                "description": "...The Flood Warning is extended for the following rivers in\nTennessee...Georgia...\n\nFrench Broad River Near Newport TN affecting Cocke and Jefferson\nCounties.\n\nSouth Chickamauga Creek Near Chickamauga TN affecting Hamilton\nand Catoosa Counties.\n\nNolichucky River At Embreeville TN affecting Greene, Washington\nand Unicoi Counties.\n\n...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in\nTennessee...\n\nPigeon River At Newport TN affecting Cocke County.\n\nFor the French Broad River...including Newport TN, DOUGLAS DAM\nRESERVOIR, DOUGLAS DAM TAILWATER...Major flooding is forecast.\nFor the South Chickamauga...including Chickamauga TN...Minor\nflooding is forecast.\nFor the Nolichucky River...including Embreeville TN...Major flooding\nis forecast.\nFor the Pigeon River...including Newport TN...Major flooding is\nforecast.\n\n* WHAT...Moderate flooding is occurring and major flooding is\nforecast. This approaches the flood of record.\n\n* WHERE...Nolichucky River at Embreeville TN.\n\n* WHEN...Until early Sunday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...At 6.5 feet, KOA campground begins to take precautions\nwith sites closest to river.\nAt 8.5 feet, KOA campground impacts increase as water flows\nthrough portions a little further in. A narrowing of the channel\njust downstream from the campground might elevate stream height in\nthe campground during higher flows due to a damming effect.\nAt 9.5 feet, Low spots along Little Germany Road will begin to flood.\nAt 11.0 feet, The main camping level of the KOA campground is\ncovered by water.\nAt 11.5 feet, Property at Bumpus Cove Road and Little Germany Road\nfloods.\nAt 12.0 feet, Pasture land around the Highway 107 bridge floods.\nThe channel narrows at the bridge just downstream of the gauge,\nwhich may elevate the river level at the gauge during higher flows\ndue to damming effect.\nAt 13.0 feet, Portions of AJ Willis Road will flood.\nAt 14.0 feet, Back yards of riverside homes along Bumpus Cove Road\ntake substantial water.\nAt 16.0 feet, Water reaches the pad of the train car at KOA\nCampground.\nAt 17.0 feet, Low spots along Hwy 107 between Embreeville and\nErwin might flood.\nAt 18.0 feet, Water might threaten the lowest of a row of\nriverside homes along Bumpus Cove Road a half mile upstream from\nthe bridge. Flows this high contain increasing uncertainty as to\nhow the gauge readings downstream near the bridge are reflective\nof stream heights and impacts along Bumpus Cove Road.\nAt 21.5 feet, A Bumpus Cove Road resident reported that the 1977\nflood was said to have gotten into the house she lives in, which\nsits on a concrete slab, while it did not get into the house next\ndoor, which sits two feet higher atop a crawl space. This is a\nsource of uncertainty of impacts at this location and its relation\nto gauge measurements downstream near the bridge and any effects\nof damming the bridge may cause near the gauge.\nAt 24.0 feet, Flood of record.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- At 11:15 AM EDT Friday the stage was 19.6 feet.\n- Bankfull stage is 7.0 feet.\n- Recent Activity...The maximum river stage in the 24 hours\nending at 11:15 AM EDT Friday was 19.6 feet.\n- Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 23.5\nfeet just after midnight tonight. It will then fall below\nflood stage late tomorrow evening.\n- Flood stage is 12.0 feet.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood",
                "instruction": "Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nMotorists should not attempt to drive around barricades or drive\ncars through flooded areas.\n\nBe especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding.\n\nAdditional information is available at www.weather.gov.\n\nThe next statement will be issued Saturday afternoon at 145 PM EDT.",

The initial\nfront will move into the panhandle Monday, bringing rain rates as\nhigh as 0.4 to 0.7 inches every 6 hours, greater at elevation. The\nsecondary front looks to have southwesterly gusts up to hurricane\nforce south of the outer waters near Haida Gwaii. Widespread gusts\nof at least 40 mph are 100-80% likely with gusts up to 50 mph\nalong the coast. High land winds, falling trees, and dangerous\nmarine conditions are all possible, with the highest likelihood in\nthe southern panhandle.\n\nCertainty is high regarding the impacts of this system, but lower\nfor the track. The likely solution currently is a westerly track\nof the parent low near Kodiak Island with additional features\ndeveloping along the storm force front for Monday.\n\nStay tuned to updates from the National Weather Service regarding\nthis evolving system.",

We are anticipating a 940 to 960 mb\nlow to move into the southern Gulf by Monday afternoon, with a\nbroad wind field of storm force winds encompassing much of the\nGulf. Gusts to hurricane force will be possible along with\npotential seas of 35 feet or higher in the Gulf offshore zones.\n\nAt this time, there is less certainty in the exact track of the\nlow, which will determine the impact level for nearshore Gulf\ncoastal waters and Kodiak Island waters. Winds could range\nanywhere from 30 kts to 65 kts, depending on the storm track.\nRegardless, there is high confidence in the low's timing and\noverall intensity. Unsettled conditions will persist into Tuesday\nmorning as the low gradually shifts eastward toward Southeast\nAlaska.\n\nStay tuned to the latest forecasts and visit for weather.gov/afc\nfor more information.",

This is resulting in catastrophic and\nhistoric inflows into Catawba River reservoirs and this water is\nbeing moved through the system to Mountain Island Lake and points\ndownstream.  Mountain Island Lake is currently at 104.2 feet and\nrising steadily.  Full pool is 100.0 feet.\n\n* Duke Energy expects Mountain Island Lake to reach or exceed 110.0\nfeet by Saturday morning, which is 10.0 feet over full pond.  This\nwould be a record pool elevation at Mountain Island Lake, breaking\nthe record of 109.60 feet which occurred in August 1940.  Mountain\nIsland Lake reached 106.91 feet on June 10, 2019. which is the\nhighest crest in the modern era.  Major Flood Stage is 105.5\nfeet.  These lake levels will cause unprecedented, catastrophic\nflooding of Mountain Island Lake and adjacent reaches of the\nCatawba River, especially downstream of Mountain Island Dam.\n\nThis is a FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY for Mountain Island Lake and\nCommunities Downstream of Mountain Island Lake Dam.

Major\nflooding is developing at Lookout Shoals Lake.\n\n* The latest pool elevations for the upper Catawba River lakes are\nas follows (Full Pool is 100.0 feet):\n\nLake James: 104.70 feet and steady.\nLake Rhodhiss: 106.40 feet and rising steadily.\nLake Hickory: 99.40 feet and steady.\nLookout Shoals Lake: 106.60 feet and rising rapidly.\n\n* Based on current rainfall forecasts and conditions, Duke Energy\nexpects Lookout Shoals Lake to reach or exceed 110.0 feet later\ntoday, which is 10.0 feet over full pond.  The current record\npool elevation at Lookout Shoals Lake is 114.40 feet which\noccurred in August 1940.  Lookout Shoals Lake reached 108.30 feet\non November 12, 2020, which is the highest crest in the modern\nera.  Major Flood Stage is 106.0 feet.  These lake levels will\ncause unprecedented, catastrophic flooding of Lookout Shoals Lake\nand possibly adjacent reaches of the Catawba River.\n\nThis is a FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY for Catawba River from below\nOxford Dam to below Lookout Shoals Lake. This is a PARTICULARLY\nDANGEROUS SITUATION. SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!\n\nHAZARD...Life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding from dam\nfloodgate releases caused by excessive rainfall.\n\nSOURCE...Duke Energy and Catawba County Emergency Management\n\nIMPACT...This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. SEEK\nHIGHER GROUND NOW!   Life-threatening, catastrophic,\nand potential historic flash flooding of areas along\nthe Catawba River from Oxford Dam to Lookout Shoals\nLake.  At 108.0 feet...Major Flooding continues.\nDevastating, widespread structural flooding within the\nCarpenters Cove community and along portions of\nLongfield St near Shadeview Ln is ongoing.\nSignificant first-floor inundation is ongoing,\nexceeding 4 feet in several locations.  Water rescues\nmay be ongoing.\n\n* Flash flooding will affect areas of the Catawba River from Oxford\nDam to near I-40, including Lookout Shoals Lake.\n\n* This has the potential to be a historic and extremely dangerous\nevent.  Please stay weather aware and monitor lake levels and Duke\nEnergy projections closely for any changes.\n\n* For more information on lake levels or dam releases, people are\nencouraged to visit http://lakes.duke-energy.com or call\n1-800-829-5253.\n\n* Residents along Lookout Shoals Lake should contact Catawba County\nEmergency Management immediately to update their contact\ninformation using the following direct link to their Community\nAlert System web page at: https://www.catawbacountync.gov/alert",
