Locally higher amounts are possible. Accumulation on\nroadways will be difficult due to warm temperatures and standing\nwater following the rain, but the higher elevations may accumulate\nsnow on roadways overnight when temperatures are coolest.\n\nThe first wave of precipitation will move through Southcentral\ntonight through Thursday morning and will spread rain across\nPrince William Sound, the Kenai Peninsula, Anchorage, and the\nMatSu Valley. Cooler air moving into the area tonight will aid in\nlower snow levels. When the next wave of precipitation arrives,\nadditional moisture and cool air will increase potential for\naccumulation at higher elevations and perhaps even light snow\ndown to sea level. Forecast confidence is low for snowfall at\nelevations below 800 feet. Little to no snow accumulation is\nexpected at lower elevations due to the ground being warmer.\nProtect sensitive outdoor plants and keep winter gear available,\nespecially if you plan to travel or be outdoors.",

Locally higher amounts are possible. Accumulation on\nroadways will be difficult due to warm temperatures and standing\nwater following the rain, but the higher elevations may accumulate\nsnow on roadways overnight when temperatures are coolest.\n\nThe first wave of precipitation will move through Southcentral\ntonight through Thursday morning and will spread rain across\nPrince William Sound, the Kenai Peninsula, Anchorage, and the\nMatSu Valley. Cooler air moving into the area tonight will aid in\nlower snow levels. When the next wave of precipitation arrives,\nadditional moisture and cool air will increase potential for\naccumulation at higher elevations and perhaps even light snow\ndown to sea level. Forecast confidence is low for snowfall at\nelevations below 800 feet. Little to no snow accumulation is\nexpected at lower elevations due to the ground being warmer.\nProtect sensitive outdoor plants and keep winter gear available,\nespecially if you plan to travel or be outdoors.",

                "description": "Beginning Wednesday night, an atmospheric river will move into SE\nAK, bringing with it heavy rain and wind. The atmospheric river\nis expected to persist through Thursday before then moving east\nThursday night and weakening. Conditions now favor the system's\ngreatest impacts focusing slightly further to the east. The\nrainfall will be aimed mostly at the northern half of the\npanhandle with the heaviest rainfall expected to be across the NE\nGulf Coast, the Glacier Bay area, and through Lynn Canal up into\nHaines and Skagway. Most stations north of Frederick Sound have a\ngreater than 60 percent chance of over 1 inch with a few from the\nIcy Strait Corridor northward and along the Outer Gulf Coast\nhaving at least a 15 percent chance of exceeding 2 inches between\nWednesday night and Thursday night. There is the possibility that\nsome areas near sea level could potentially see rainfall totals\napproaching 3 inches by the time the system has departed Thursday\nnight through Friday morning. At elevation, rainfall totals could\napproach 5 inches total in the Coast Mountains. The potential for\ndaily rainfall records to be broken across parts of the Northern\nhalf of the panhandle north of Frederick Sound does exist, and\nriver rises are expected, though no flooding is anticipated at\nthis time.\n\nAnticipate windy conditions across land-based areas, with gusts up\nto 35 or 40 kt possible for some locations near sea level,\nespecially for the northern half of the panhandle, along with\nsmall craft winds for the inner channels and gale force winds for\nthe outer coastal waters.",
