Prepare for limited wind damage.\n- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind\nbecomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees\nare shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown\nover.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within\nurban or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving\nconditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 1-3 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Friday afternoon until Saturday evening\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot\nabove ground.\n- PREPARE: Efforts should now be underway to prepare for\nstorm surge flooding, especially in low-lying vulnerable\nareas.\n- ACT: Take actions to protect life and property. Prepare to\nleave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along\nimmediate shorelines and in low-lying areas along rivers\nthat are tidal influenced.\n- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become\noverspread with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous\nin places where surge water begins to cover roads, this\nincludes low areas around Kenduskeag Plaza and Bangor\nWaterfront\n- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, and\npiers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 1-3 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for\nmoderate flooding rain\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain.

Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations\nand rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, arroyos, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places may experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected.

Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 1-3 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Friday afternoon until Saturday evening\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot\nabove ground.\n- PREPARE: Efforts should now be underway to prepare for\nstorm surge flooding, especially in low-lying vulnerable\nareas.\n- ACT: Take actions to protect life and property. Prepare to\nleave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along\nimmediate shorelines and in low-lying areas along rivers\nthat are tidal influenced.\n- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become\noverspread with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous\nin places where surge water begins to cover roads, this\nincludes Deer Isle Causeway, Main Street in Winter Harbor,\nPeabody Drive in Seal Harbor and the harbor parking lot in\nStonington.\n- High dangerous surf and strong rip currents will make for\nhazardous surf conditions.\n- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, and\npiers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 2-4 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for\nmoderate flooding rain\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations\nand rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, arroyos, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places may experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected. Showers and thunderstorms\nwith gusty winds may still occur.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations needed to protect\nagainst tornadoes at this time. Keep informed of the latest\ntornado situation.\n- ACT: Listen for changes in the forecast.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- Local evacuation and sheltering information: https://facebook.com/HancockCountyEMA/ and https://maine.gov/mema/hazards/natural-hazards/hurricanes",

                "description": "* LOCATIONS AFFECTED\n- Orrington\n\n* WIND\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Below tropical storm force wind\n- Peak Wind Forecast: 20-30 mph with gusts to 45 mph\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 39\nto 57 mph\n- PLAN: Plan for hazardous wind of equivalent tropical storm\nforce.\n- PREPARE: Efforts to protect property should now be\nunderway. Prepare for limited wind damage.\n- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind\nbecomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees\nare shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown\nover.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within\nurban or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving\nconditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 1-3 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Friday afternoon until Saturday evening\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot\nabove ground.\n- PREPARE: Efforts should now be underway to prepare for\nstorm surge flooding, especially in low-lying vulnerable\nareas.\n- ACT: Take actions to protect life and property. Prepare to\nleave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along\nimmediate shorelines and in low-lying areas along rivers\nthat are tidal influenced.\n- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become\noverspread with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous\nin places where surge water begins to cover roads, this\nincludes low areas around Kenduskeag Plaza and Bangor\nWaterfront\n- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, and\npiers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 2-4 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for\nmoderate flooding rain\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations\nand rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, arroyos, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places may experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected. Showers and thunderstorms\nwith gusty winds may still occur.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations needed to protect\nagainst tornadoes at this time. Keep informed of the latest\ntornado situation.\n- ACT: Listen for changes in the forecast.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://maine.gov/mema/hazards/natural-hazards/hurricanes",

Prepare for significant wind damage.\n- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind\nbecomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 1-3 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Friday afternoon until Saturday evening\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot\nabove ground.\n- PREPARE: Efforts should now be underway to prepare for\nstorm surge flooding, especially in low-lying vulnerable\nareas.\n- ACT: Take actions to protect life and property. Prepare to\nleave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along\nimmediate shorelines and in low-lying areas along rivers\nthat are tidal influenced.\n- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become\noverspread with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous\nin places where surge water begins to cover roads, this\nincludes Deer Isle Causeway, Main Street in Machias, and\nStarboard Cove road.\n- High dangerous surf and strong rip currents will make for\nhazardous surf conditions.\n- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, and\npiers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 2-4 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for\nmoderate flooding rain\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations\nand rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, arroyos, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places may experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected.

                "description": "This product covers NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WESTERN MAINE\n\n**Tropical Storm Watch Issued**\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for Coastal Cumberland,\nCoastal Rockingham, Coastal Waldo, Coastal York, Interior\nWaldo, Knox, Lincoln, and Sagadahoc\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Coastal Cumberland,\nCoastal Rockingham, Coastal Waldo, Coastal York, Interior\nWaldo, Knox, Lincoln, and Sagadahoc\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 1130 miles south of Portland ME or about 1090 miles south\nof Portsmouth NH\n- 27.4N 67.6W\n- Storm Intensity 105 mph\n- Movement North-northwest or 340 degrees at 10 mph\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\nHurricane Lee has begun to move north today which will continue\nthrough the end of the week, bringing it into the Gulf of Maine late\nFriday night or early Saturday. As the storm moves north, it is\nexpected to weaken, but the wind field will expand significantly.\n\nTherefore, the potential exists for tropical storm conditions to\ndevelop by Friday afternoon...continuing Friday night through Saturday\nafternoon. The strongest winds are expected across coastal portions of\nwestern Maine and New Hampshire.\n\nLarge, pounding surf in addition to one to three feet of storm surge\nwill bring the potential for beach erosion and minor to moderate\ncoastal flooding.\n\nHeavy rainfall is also possible, particularly across Midcoast Maine\nwhere localized flooding will be possible.\n\nThere remains some uncertainty with regards to the track of Lee, which\nwill play a role in the level of impacts experienced a. cross the\narea, but confidence is higher the further east you move. Please check\nback frequently for the latest updates.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* WIND:\nPrepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across\ncoastal New Hampshire and Maine. Potential impacts in this area include:\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage\nto porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings\nexperiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile\nhomes are damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured\nlightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted, leading to downed\npower lines.\n- Many roads are impassable from debris, caused by downed trees\nand power lines. Many bridges, causeways, and access routes\nimpassable.\n- Numerous power and communications outages likely.\n\nAlso, prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts\nacross interior areas of Maine and the higher elevations.\n\nElsewhere across NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WESTERN MAINE, little to no impact\nis anticipated.\n\n* SURGE:\nPrepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts\nacross vulnerable low lying areas of coastal New Hampshire and Maine.\nPotential impacts in this area include:\n- Localized inundation of up to 2 feet mainly along low-lying\nspots on the immediate shorelines and in tidal affected\nriverine areas farther inland. Storm surge flooding could be\naccentuated by large waves in vulnerable wave action shoreline\nlocations.\n- Sections of near-shore roads, causeways, and parking lots\nbecome overspread with surge water. Dangerous driving\nconditions in places where surge water covers the road.\n- Minor to moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching\ndunes, mainly in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip\ncurrents.\n- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A few\nsmall craft broken away from moorings. No damage to revetments\nexpected.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPrepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant\nimpacts across central Maine. Potential impacts include:\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and\nrescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter\ncurrents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially\nin usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and\nditches will overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.\nSeveral places may experience expanded areas of rapid\ninundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as\nstorm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions\nwill become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.\n\nPrepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\nlimited impacts across western Maine.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nLittle to no impacts are anticipated at this time across NEW HAMPSHIRE\nAND WESTERN MAINE.\n\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS\n----------------------------------\n\n* EVACUATIONS:\n\nWATCH/WARNING PHASE - If evacuating the area, stick to prescribed\nevacuation routes. Look for additional traffic information on roadway\nsmart signs and listen to select radio channels for further travel\ninstructions. Drivers should not use cell phones while operating\nvehicles.\n\nWATCH/WARNING PHASE - For those not under evacuation orders,\nunderstand that there are inherent risks to evacuation (such as\ntraffic congestion, accidents, and driving in bad weather), so\nevacuate only if necessary. Help keep roadways open for those that\nare under evacuation orders.\n\nWATCH/WARNING PHASE - If evacuating away from the area or relocating\nto a nearby shelter, leave early before weather conditions become\nhazardous.\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nNow is the time to check your emergency plan and take necessary\nactions to secure your home or business. Deliberate efforts should be\nunderway to protect life and property. Ensure that your Emergency\nSupplies Kit is stocked and ready.\n\nWhen making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the\nexact forecast track as there are inherent forecast uncertainties\nwhich must be taken into account.\n\nIf you live in a place that is particularly vulnerable to high wind,\nsuch as a mobile home, an upper floor of a high rise building, or on\na boat, plan to move to safe shelter. Take enough supplies for you\nand your family for several days.\n\nAlways heed the advice of local officials and comply with any orders\nthat are issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives\nof others.\n\nWhen securing your property, outside preparations should be conducted\nas soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of\nstrong gusty winds and heavy rain can cause certain preparedness\nactivities to become unsafe.\n\nVisitors to the area should become familiar with nearby surroundings.\nIf you are a visitor, know the name of the county in which\nyou are located and where it is relative to current watches and\nwarnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their\nonsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially\npertaining to area visitors.\n\nClosely monitor NOAA Weather Radio or other local news outlets for\nofficial storm information. Listen for possible changes to the\nforecast.\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org\n\nNEXT UPDATE\n-----------\n\nThe next local statement will be issued by the National Weather\nService in Gray ME around 11 PM EDT, or sooner if conditions warrant.",

Lee\nshould bring rough surf, damaging winds, and bands of heavy rain to at\nleast coastal areas of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\n\nThe following are the primary hazards of concern with Lee:\n\n* Rough surf - Ocean beaches will experience dangerous rip currents and\nbeach erosion through the weekend. Rough seas will also pose a\nsignificant hazard to mariners.\n\n* Damaging wind - Winds will increase on Friday and remain gusty\nthrough Saturday night. Tropical storm force winds are possible\nlate Friday night and Saturday near the coast, where downed branches\nor trees are possible since trees are fully leafed and root systems\nmay be weakened from saturated soils.\n\n* Flooding rainfall - Bands of heavy rain may result in flash flooding\nFriday night and Saturday, mainly near the coast. Rainfall totals of\n2 to 4 inches are possible in a short period of time.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* WIND:\nPrepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across\ncoastal Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Potential impacts in this area\ninclude:\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are\nshallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on\nbridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages.\n\nElsewhere across Southern New England, little to no impact is\nanticipated.\n\n* SURGE:\nStorm surge inundation of 2 to 4 feet above ground level possible along\nthe northern coast of Barnstable county along Cape Cod Bay, and along\nthe northern coast of Nantucket.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPrepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible limited\nimpacts across eastern Massachusetts. Potential impacts include:\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.\nSmall streams, creeks, and ditches may become swollen and\noverflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually\nvulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water\noccurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become\nnear-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge\nclosures.\n\nElsewhere across Southern New England, little to no impact is\nanticipated.\n\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS\n----------------------------------\n\n* EVACUATIONS:\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,\nincluding possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so\nimmediately.\n\nFor those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,\nfalling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,\nrelocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep\nroadways open for those under evacuation orders.\n\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nNow is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies\nkit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your\nhome or business.\n\nWhen making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the\nexact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging\nwind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the\ncenter of the storm.\n\nIf in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large\ntrees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or\non a boat, plan to move to safe shelter.\n\nIf you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as\nnear the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor\ndrainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to\nmove to safe shelter on higher ground.\n\nAlways heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that\nare issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of\nothers.\n\nWhen securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded\nas soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of\nstrong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness\nactivities to become unsafe.\n\nBe sure to let friends and family members know of your intentions for\nweathering the storm and your whereabouts. Have someone located away\nfrom the threatened area serve as your point of contact. Share vital\ncontact information with others. Keep cell phones handy and charged.\n\nCheck on those who may not be fully aware of the situation or who are\nunable to make personal preparations.\n\nIf you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which\nyou are located and where it is relative to current watches and\nwarnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their\nonsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially\npertaining to area visitors.\n\nClosely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news\noutlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes\nto the forecast.\n\nThere is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways\nto receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org\n\nNEXT UPDATE\n-----------\n\nThe next local statement will be issued by the National Weather\nService in Boston/Norton MA around 12 AM EDT Thursday, or sooner if\nconditions warrant.",

                "description": "This product covers Eastern and Northern Maine\n\n**Hurricane Watch and Tropical Wind Watch Issued for Downeast as Lee\nApproaches Maine**\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Hurricane Watch has been issued for Coastal Hancock and\nCoastal Washington\n- A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for Central Washington,\nInterior Hancock, and Southern Penobscot\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Hurricane Watch is in effect for Coastal Hancock and Coastal\nWashington\n- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Central Washington,\nInterior Hancock, and Southern Penobscot\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 1160 miles south of Stonington ME or about 1210 miles\nsouth of Eastport ME\n- 27.4N 67.6W\n- Storm Intensity 105 mph\n- Movement North-northwest or 340 degrees at 10 mph\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\n\n- Forecaster confidence continues to increase that Lee will make\nlandfall either on or just east of the coast of Maine late Saturday\nor Sunday\n- Large pounding surf is almost a definite at this point with coastal\nand marine impacts expected to begin as early as late tonight\n- Although additional impacts from winds and flooding are still\nuncertain, you should be planning for a strong tropical storm or\ncategory 1 hurricane\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* WIND:\nPrepare for dangerous wind having possible significant impacts across\nDowneast Maine. Potential impacts in this area include:\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with damage\nto porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings\nexperiencing window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile\nhomes damaged, especially if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight\nobjects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent\nin areas with above ground lines.\n\nAlso, prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts\nacross Interior Downeast Maine and the Bangor Region.\n\nElsewhere across Eastern and Northern Maine, less impact is\nanticipated.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPrepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant\nimpacts across Downeast Maine. Potential impacts include:\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and\nrescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter\ncurrents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially\nin usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals,\narroyos, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.\nSeveral places may experience expanded areas of rapid\ninundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as\nstorm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions\nbecome hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.\n\n\n* SURGE:\nPrepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited impacts\nacross coastal Downeast Maine. Potential impacts in this area include:\n- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along\nimmediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas\nfarther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.\n- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become overspread\nwith surge water. Driving conditions dangerous in places where\nsurge water covers the road.\n- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes, mainly\nin usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.\n- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks,\nand piers. A few small craft broken away from moorings.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nLittle to no impacts are anticipated at this time across Eastern and\nNorthern Maine.\n\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS\n----------------------------------\n\n* EVACUATIONS:\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,\nincluding possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so\nimmediately.\n\nFor those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,\nfalling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,\nrelocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep\nroadways open for those under evacuation orders.\n\nIf evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time\nto get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle\nahead of time.\n\nLet others know where you are going prior to departure. Secure loose\nitems and pets in the car, and avoid distracted driving.\n\nIf evacuating, follow designated evacuation routes. Seek traffic\ninformation on roadway signs, the radio, and from official sources.\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nNow is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies\nkit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your\nhome or business.\n\nWhen making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the\nexact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging\nwind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the\ncenter of the storm.\n\nIf in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large\ntrees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or\non a boat, plan to move to safe shelter.\n\nIf you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as\nnear the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor\ndrainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to\nmove to safe shelter on higher ground.\n\nAlways heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that\nare issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of\nothers.\n\nWhen securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded\nas soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of\nstrong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness\nactivities to become unsafe.\n\nBe sure to let friends and family members know of your intentions for\nweathering the storm and your whereabouts. Have someone located away\nfrom the threatened area serve as your point of contact. Share vital\ncontact information with others. Keep cell phones handy and charged.\n\nCheck on those who may not be fully aware of the situation or who are\nunable to make personal preparations.\n\nIf you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which\nyou are located and where it is relative to current watches and\nwarnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their\nonsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially\npertaining to area visitors.\n\nClosely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news\noutlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes\nto the forecast.\n\nThere is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways\nto receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.\n\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org\n\nNEXT UPDATE\n-----------\n\nThe next local statement will be issued by the National Weather\nService in Caribou ME around 11 PM EDT, or sooner if conditions\nwarrant.",

Prepare for limited wind damage.\n- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind\nbecomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, leading to downed power lines.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, caused by downed\nbranches and power lines. Hazardous driving conditions on\nbridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages likely.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for up to 2 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot\nabove ground.\n- PREPARE: Efforts should now be underway to prepare for\nstorm surge flooding, especially in low-lying vulnerable\nareas.\n- ACT: Take actions to protect life and property. Prepare to\nleave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation of up to 2 feet mainly along low-lying\nspots on the immediate shorelines and in tidal affected\nriverine areas farther inland. Storm surge flooding could\nbe accentuated by large waves in vulnerable wave action\nshoreline locations.\n- Sections of near-shore roads, causeways, and parking lots\nbecome overspread with surge water.Dangerous driving\nconditions in places where surge water covers the road.\nSmall rocks embedded in overtopping waves can result in\ndamage to passing vehicles or injuries to pedestrians.\n- Minor to moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching\ndunes, mainly in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip\ncurrents.\n- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A\nfew small craft broken away from moorings. No damage to\nrevetments expected.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 1-3 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for\nmoderate flooding rain\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations\nand rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches will overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places may experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions will become hazardous. Some road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected. Showers and thunderstorms\nwith gusty winds may still occur.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations needed to protect\nagainst tornadoes at this time. Keep informed of the latest\ntornado situation.\n- ACT: Listen for changes in the forecast.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for limited wind damage.\n- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind\nbecomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, leading to downed power lines.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, caused by downed\nbranches and power lines. Hazardous driving conditions on\nbridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages likely.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for up to 2 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot\nabove ground.\n- PREPARE: Efforts should now be underway to prepare for\nstorm surge flooding, especially in low-lying vulnerable\nareas.\n- ACT: Take actions to protect life and property. Prepare to\nleave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation of up to 2 feet mainly along low-lying\nspots on the immediate shorelines and in tidal affected\nriverine areas farther inland. Storm surge flooding could\nbe accentuated by large waves in vulnerable wave action\nshoreline locations.\n- Sections of near-shore roads, causeways, and parking lots\nbecome overspread with surge water. Driving conditions\ndangerous in places where surge water covers the road.\n- Minor to moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching\ndunes, mainly in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip\ncurrents.\n- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A\nfew small craft broken away from moorings. No damage to\nrevetments expected.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional around 1 inch\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for\nlocalized flooding rain\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected.

Prepare for limited wind damage.\n- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind\nbecomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, leading to downed power lines.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, caused by downed\nbranches and power lines. Hazardous driving conditions on\nbridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages likely.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for up to 2 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot\nabove ground.\n- PREPARE: Efforts should now be underway to prepare for\nstorm surge flooding, especially in low-lying vulnerable\nareas.\n- ACT: Take actions to protect life and property. Prepare to\nleave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation of up to 2 feet mainly along low-lying\nspots on the immediate shorelines and in tidal affected\nriverine areas farther inland. Storm surge flooding could\nbe accentuated by large waves in vulnerable wave action\nshoreline locations.\n- Sections of near-shore roads, causeways, and parking lots\nbecome overspread with surge water. Dangerous driving\nconditions in places where surge water covers the road.\n- Minor to moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching\ndunes, mainly in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip\ncurrents.\n- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A\nfew small craft broken away from moorings. No damage to\nrevetments expected.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional around 1 inch\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for\nlocalized flooding rain\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected.

Prepare for limited wind damage.\n- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind\nbecomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, leading to downed power lines.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, caused by downed\nbranches and power lines. Hazardous driving conditions on\nbridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages likely.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for up to 2 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot\nabove ground.\n- PREPARE: Efforts should now be underway to prepare for\nstorm surge flooding, especially in low-lying vulnerable\nareas.\n- ACT: Take actions to protect life and property. Prepare to\nleave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation of up to 2 feet mainly along low-lying\nspots on the immediate shorelines and in tidal affected\nriverine areas farther inland. Storm surge flooding could\nbe accentuated by large waves in vulnerable wave action\nshoreline locations.\n- Sections of near-shore roads, causeways, and parking lots\nbecome overspread with surge water. Dangerous driving\nconditions in places where surge water covers the road.\nSmall rocks embedded in overtopping waves can result in\ndamage to passing vehicles or injuries to pedestrians.\n- Minor to moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching\ndunes, mainly in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip\ncurrents.\n- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A\nfew small craft broken away from moorings. No damage to\nrevetments expected.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional around 1 inch\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for\nlocalized flooding rain\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected. Showers and thunderstorms\nwith gusty winds may still occur.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations needed to protect\nagainst tornadoes at this time. Keep informed of the latest\ntornado situation.\n- ACT: Listen for changes in the forecast.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for limited wind damage.\n- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind\nbecomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, leading to downed power lines.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, caused by downed\nbranches and power lines. Hazardous driving conditions on\nbridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages likely.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for up to 2 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot\nabove ground.\n- PREPARE: Efforts should now be underway to prepare for\nstorm surge flooding, especially in low-lying vulnerable\nareas.\n- ACT: Take actions to protect life and property. Prepare to\nleave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation of up to 2 feet mainly along low-lying\nspots on the immediate shorelines and in tidal affected\nriverine areas farther inland. Storm surge flooding could\nbe accentuated by large waves in vulnerable wave action\nshoreline locations.\n- Sections of near-shore roads, causeways, and parking lots\nbecome overspread with surge water. Dangerous driving\nconditions in places where surge water covers the road.\n- Minor to moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching\ndunes, mainly in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip\ncurrents.\n- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A\nfew small craft broken away from moorings. No damage to\nrevetments expected.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 1-3 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Little or no\npotential for flooding rain\n- PLAN: There is little or no potential for flooding rain.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations are needed to protect\nagainst flooding rain at this time.\n- ACT: Monitor for changes to the forecast.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from flooding rain.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected.

Prepare for significant wind damage.\n- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind\nbecomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes are damaged, especially if\nunanchored. Unsecured lightweight objects become dangerous\nprojectiles.\n- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted, leading to downed\npower lines.\n- Many roads are impassable from debris, caused by downed\ntrees and power lines. Many bridges, causeways, and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Numerous power and communications outages likely.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for up to 2 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot\nabove ground.\n- PREPARE: Efforts should now be underway to prepare for\nstorm surge flooding, especially in low-lying vulnerable\nareas.\n- ACT: Take actions to protect life and property. Prepare to\nleave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation of up to 2 feet mainly along low-lying\nspots on the immediate shorelines and in tidal affected\nriverine areas farther inland. Storm surge flooding could\nbe accentuated by large waves in vulnerable wave action\nshoreline locations.\n- Sections of near-shore roads, causeways, and parking lots\nbecome overspread with surge water. Dangerous driving\nconditions in places where surge water covers the road.\nSmall rocks embedded in overtopping waves can result in\ndamage to passing vehicles or injuries to pedestrians.\n- Minor to moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching\ndunes, mainly in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip\ncurrents.\n- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A\nfew small craft broken away from moorings. No damage to\nrevetments expected.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 1-3 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for\nmoderate flooding rain\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations\nand rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches will overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places may experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions will become hazardous. Some road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected. Showers and thunderstorms\nwith gusty winds may still occur.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations needed to protect\nagainst tornadoes at this time. Keep informed of the latest\ntornado situation.\n- ACT: Listen for changes in the forecast.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for limited wind damage.\n- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind\nbecomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, leading to downed power lines.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, caused by downed\nbranches and power lines. Hazardous driving conditions on\nbridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages likely.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for up to 2 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot\nabove ground.\n- PREPARE: Efforts should now be underway to prepare for\nstorm surge flooding, especially in low-lying vulnerable\nareas.\n- ACT: Take actions to protect life and property. Prepare to\nleave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation of up to 2 feet mainly along low-lying\nspots on the immediate shorelines and in tidal affected\nriverine areas farther inland. Storm surge flooding could\nbe accentuated by large waves in vulnerable wave action\nshoreline locations.\n- Sections of near-shore roads, causeways, and parking lots\nbecome overspread with surge water. Dangerous driving\nconditions in places where surge water covers the road.\n- Minor to moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching\ndunes, mainly in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip\ncurrents.\n- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A\nfew small craft broken away from moorings. No damage to\nrevetments expected.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 1-3 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for\nmoderate flooding rain\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations\nand rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches will overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places may experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions will become hazardous. Some road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected. Showers and thunderstorms\nwith gusty winds may still occur.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations needed to protect\nagainst tornadoes at this time. Keep informed of the latest\ntornado situation.\n- ACT: Listen for changes in the forecast.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for significant wind damage.\n- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind\nbecomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes are damaged, especially if\nunanchored. Unsecured lightweight objects become dangerous\nprojectiles.\n- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted, leading to downed\npower lines.\n- Many roads are impassable from debris, caused by downed\ntrees and power lines. Many bridges, causeways, and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Numerous power and communications outages likely.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for up to 2 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 1 foot above ground\n- PLAN: Plan for storm surge flooding greater than 1 foot\nabove ground.\n- PREPARE: Efforts should now be underway to prepare for\nstorm surge flooding, especially in low-lying vulnerable\nareas.\n- ACT: Take actions to protect life and property. Prepare to\nleave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation of up to 2 feet mainly along low-lying\nspots on the immediate shorelines and in tidal affected\nriverine areas farther inland. Storm surge flooding could\nbe accentuated by large waves in vulnerable wave action\nshoreline locations.\n- Sections of near-shore roads, causeways, and parking lots\nbecome overspread with surge water. Dangerous driving\nconditions in places where surge water covers the road.\nSmall rocks embedded in overtopping waves can result in\ndamage to passing vehicles or injuries to pedestrians.\n- Minor to moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching\ndunes, mainly in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip\ncurrents.\n- Minor damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. A\nfew small craft broken away from moorings. No damage to\nrevetments expected.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 1-3 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for\nmoderate flooding rain\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations\nand rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches will overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places may experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions will become hazardous. Some road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST\nUNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected. Showers and thunderstorms\nwith gusty winds may still occur.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations needed to protect\nagainst tornadoes at this time. Keep informed of the latest\ntornado situation.\n- ACT: Listen for changes in the forecast.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://ready.gov/hurricanes",

For\nthe High Rip Current Risk, through late Thursday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...Rip currents that can sweep even the best swimmers\naway from shore into deeper water where it becomes difficult\nto return to safety. Dangerous swimming conditions and\nlocalized beach erosion.\n\n* ADDITIONAL INFORMATION...Most vulnerable areas prone to minor\ncoastal flooding may be affected.",
                "instruction": "A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in\nthe advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and\ndangerous swimming conditions.\n\nThere is a high risk of rip currents.\n\nRip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away\nfrom shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the\nsandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties\nand piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain\ncalm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.",

It is\nextremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you\nare in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at\nall times.\n\nStrong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip\ncurrents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas.

Creeks and streams may rise out of their\nbanks. Low-water crossings may be flooded.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- The ground on the Hermits Peak Calf Canyon Burn Scar became\nsaturated from up to 1.50 inches of rain on Tuesday, so even\nmoderate rainfall could result in rapid runoff and flash\nflooding today. High resolution models depict multiple\nthunderstorms tracking fairly slowly eastward off the burn\nscar this afternoon until sunset, and this motion down the\ndrainage basins will increase the risk of flash flooding.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood",

Dangerous swimming conditions and\nlocalized beach erosion.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...It is very likely that the High Rip\nCurrent Risk statements and High Surf Advisory might be\nextended through most of next week as Hurricane Lee continues\nmoving northward over the western Atlantic.

Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain\ncalm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.\n\nA High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in\nthe advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and\ndangerous swimming conditions.",
